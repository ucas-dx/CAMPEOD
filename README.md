# CAMPEOD
In medical research, organoids, which exhibit 
structural and functional resemblances to authentic organs, 
offer a substantial avenue for delving into aspects encompassing 
physiology, pathophysiology, diseases, and pharmaceutical 
screening. Critical insights into drug responsiveness are often 
gleaned from these organoids' dimensional and configurational 
disparities. However, conventional detection methodologies 
reliant upon fluorescent labeling engender potential hazards to 
organoid integrity, thereby impinging upon their intrinsic 
dynamic attributes. Traditional bounding-box detection 
methodologies fall short in encapsulating intricate 
morphological particulars, and certain deep-learning 
approaches grapple with the intricate task of capturing multiscale data, particularly when tasked with discerning organ-like 
structures characterized by marked shape and size 
heterogeneities. In a bid to surmount these constraints, our 
study introduces CAMPEOD, an innovative framework that 
synergistically amalgamates multi-scale attributes derived from 
organoid specimens, employing cross-attention mechanisms. 
This novel approach effectively obviates superfluous 
background interference and image noise, thereby endowing an 
automated, finely-tuned dissection of organoid samples. 
Significantly, this segmentation process ensures congruence 
with authentic organoid quantities and morphological 
characteristics. By facilitating comprehensive scrutiny of 
microscopy images of organoid samples on a large scale, 
CAMPEOD assumes considerable implications for the realm of 
pharmaceutical screening and ailment emulation.
